A complete, detailed **prompt** that I can use directly in DALL·E to generate an image that closely matches the original.\n\nFor the prompt, ensure you include: an exact description of the composition, the visual style (e.g. digital painting, photorealistic, 3D render, sketch, etc.), color scheme, perspective, lighting sources and intensity, textures, all visible objects and details (including people, clothing, facial expressions, posture), background elements, and any visible text (transcribe this exactly). Use structured, precise language and describe the scene in a way that allows DALL·E to recreate the image as accurately as possible. Present the prompt in a clearly formatted Markdown code block.",
